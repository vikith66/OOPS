Let's analyze the given for loops one by one in C++:
1. for (i = 1; i <=10; i++); cout << i << endl;

    Compile? Yes, it will compile.

    Run? Yes, it will run.

    Print out a line? Yes, it prints one line.

    Prints out multiple lines? No, it prints only one line.

    Explanation: The semicolon after the for loop makes it an empty loop, so the loop runs without doing anything. After the loop ends, cout << i << endl; prints the final value of i, which will be 11.

2. for (j = 11; j < 11; ++j); cout << j << endl;

    Compile? Yes, it will compile.

    Run? Yes, it will run.

    Print out a line? Yes, it prints one line.

    Prints out multiple lines? No, it prints only one line.

    Explanation: The loop condition j < 11 is false from the start (since j is initialized to 11), so the loop does not run. The code then prints the value of j, which is still 11.

3. int j=100; for (int j = 1; j <=10; j++); cout << j << endl;

    Compile? Yes, it will compile.

    Run? Yes, it will run.

    Print out a line? Yes, it prints one line.

    Prints out multiple lines? No, it prints only one line.

    Explanation: The inner for loop uses a local variable j, which shadows the outer j = 100. After the loop, the outer j (which is still 100) is printed.

4. for (j = 1; j <= 10; j++) cout << "Hello\n";

    Compile? Yes, it will compile.

    Run? Yes, it will run.

    Print out a line? Yes, it prints out a line.

    Prints out multiple lines? Yes, it prints multiple lines.

    Explanation: The loop runs 10 times, printing "Hello\n" each time. This results in multiple lines of output.

5. for (j = 1; j <= 10; j++) { if( j < 5) continue; cout << j << "\n"; }

    Compile? Yes, it will compile.

    Run? Yes, it will run.

    Print out a line? Yes, it prints out a line.

    Prints out multiple lines? Yes, it prints multiple lines.

    Explanation: The continue statement skips printing for j < 5, so the loop prints j for values 5 to 10. Therefore, it prints multiple lines.

6. for (j = 1, j <= 10, j++) cout << "Hello\n";

    Compile? No, it will not compile.

    Run? No, it will not run.

    Print out a line? No.

    Prints out multiple lines? No.

    Explanation: The use of commas in the for loop condition is incorrect. The proper syntax uses semicolons, not commas. Therefore, it will not compile.

Summary Table
No.	Action	Compile?	Run?	Print out a line?	Prints out multiple lines?

3	int j=100; for (int j = 1; j <=10; j++); cout << j << endl;	Yes	Yes	Yes	No
4	for (j = 1; j <= 10; j++) cout << "Hello\n";	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes
5	for (j = 1; j <= 10; j++) { if( j < 5) continue; cout << j << "\n"; }	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes
6	for (j = 1, j <= 10, j++) cout << "Hello\n";	No	No	No	No
